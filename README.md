## Background Info

### Abbreviations
In the list of daily events, some cryptic abbreviations are used to make best use of the limited space.

Abbreviations used for occultations:
- `DD` disappearance at the dark limb of the Moon
- `DB` disappearance at the bright limb of the Moon
- `RD` reappearance at the dark limb of the Moon
- `RB` reappearance at the bright limb of the Moon

Abbreviations for some astronomical events:
- `IC` inferior conjunction of a planet with the Sun
- `SC` superior conjunction of a planet with the Sun
- `GE` greatest elongation of a planet from the Sun


### Missing Diagram for Jupiter
Some days have no diagram for the moons of Jupiter. 

Those are days for which Jupiter is too close to the Sun to be observed.


### 80%-Range
The `80%-range` is used to give an idea of the scatter in data.

The `80%-range` means that 80% of the data is within that given range, between a minimum and a maximum.

### Smoothing Of Weather Data
Weather data is inherently variable.
Even with, say, 50 years of data, the variation in the median daily high temperature has significant scatter from one day to the next. 

Because of this, the Islander's Almanac applies some smoothing to weather data.
For each day, the data for plus-and-minus 3 days on either side of the given date is added together and taken as a unit.
